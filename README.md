# YES-NO-Environment-Perspective-You-Myself-Observer-Paradox
This book has four names because it lives in four states at once. YES / NO — the binary that refuses purity. Environmental Perspective — the field where truth shifts with context. You / Myself — the routing rule of care without control. Observer Paradox — the reminder that seeing changes what you see.
