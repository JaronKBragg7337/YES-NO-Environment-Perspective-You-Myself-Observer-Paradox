# Chapter 7 — The Bridge Protocol: Build for Many Futures

A good system survives migration — of users, of time, of context.

My build logic:

1. Local-first.
1. Constraint-first.
1. Capability stacking.
1. Distributed authority.
1. Late collapse.
1. Honest logging.
1. Design for continuation.

It’s stricter than morality because it has to survive physics.

And if You Over Myself is real, it has to survive other people’s environments, not just mine.
