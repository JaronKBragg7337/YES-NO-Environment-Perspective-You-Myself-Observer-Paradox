# Chapter 9 — Tent Era to Now: You Over Myself as a Build Law

YOM didn’t start as a slogan. It started as an upgrade I couldn’t unsee.

The Tent Era wasn’t just “hard times.” It was the moment my priorities got re-wired by a bigger constraint than my own pain.

Because once you’ve lived with no margin, you start noticing how many people live with less than that — permanently.

And that changes you.

## 9.1 — What YOM Actually Is

You Over Myself is not martyrdom.
It’s not self-hate.
It’s not “let people use you.”
It’s not savior logic.

It’s a routing law:

> When I have surplus capacity and someone else is blocked at survival, the build is incomplete.

So I route my choices like this:

- Preserve agency.
- Provide floors.
- Reduce forced collapse.
- Don’t trap people inside my certainty.

That’s why my “help” has rules — because control is the easiest way to cosplay care.

And sometimes the best rules are the ones that stay slightly vague, on purpose, so they can survive more environments than the one that created them.

## 9.2 — Why It Changed Me (Tent Era)

In the Tent Era, survival got quiet enough for empathy to come online.

Before that, I was in escape mode.
Prove mode.
Defend mode.

But once I stabilized even a little, the question stopped being:
*“How do I get out?”*

And became:
*“How do I build something that makes ‘out’ exist for other people too?”*

That pivot is the seed of everything I build now.

## 9.3 — The Evolution (Tent Era → Now)

YOM didn’t stay “a belief.” It became architecture.

**Phase 1 — Seeing**

I started noticing that most pain is not personal failure — it’s environment pressure.

People don’t “choose” collapse the way observers pretend they do.
They get boxed in by constraints: money, housing, health, geography, institutions, trauma, timing.

So YOM began as: *Stop judging. Start mapping constraints.*

**Phase 2 — Building Floors**

Then it evolved into: *If you can build floors, build them.*

Not speeches. Not labels. Not inspiration. Floors.

- Energy floors (power that doesn’t depend on permission).
- Water floors (access that doesn’t require gatekeeping).
- Tool floors (capabilities people can stack).
- Learning floors (knowledge without humiliation).
- Systems floors (process that doesn’t punish instability).

**Phase 3 — Designing Against Tyranny**

Then it matured into a protective rule: *If I’m not careful, even “help” can become tyranny.*

So now YOM forces me to ask:

- Am I preserving agency or stealing it?
- Am I creating capability or dependency?
- Am I building a bridge or a cage?
- Am I making something that works in their environment or only mine?

This is the point: **YOM isn’t emotion. It’s anti-domination engineering.**

-----

## 9.4 — What YOM Looks Like in My Builds

This is why I build the way I do:

- Capability stacking instead of “this OR that.”
- Late collapse so people aren’t forced into one outcome.
- No ranking because ranking becomes permission systems.
- No coercion because coercion is just control wearing a clean shirt.
- Distributed authority because single-point control becomes abuse in the wrong hands.
- Local-first because dependence is a soft form of captivity.

Even when I’m building something “technical,” the routing is still the same:
A bridge must hold weight for other people, not just for me.

-----

## 9.5 — YOM’s Hardest Rule

YOM also means I can’t devalue anyone to make myself feel safe.

Because devaluation is always the first tool of cruelty.

So the rule becomes:

- Value everything.
- Trust selectively.
- Respect universally.

That’s how I keep the builder from turning into the tyrant.
