# Appendices

## Appendix A — Full Timeline Log (Raw)

⛔ **WITHHELD — Appendix A: Raw timeline insertion point**

- **Purpose:** Preserve full life log
- **Withheld:** Length + isolated sensitive details you may choose to fill manually
- **Fill-in cue:** N/A

## Appendix B — Memory Capture Method (So Nothing Gets Lost)

Use this format any time something surfaces that belongs in the record:

```
Memory Capture Entry
- Date recalled:
- Where it happened:
- What surfaced:
- Why it matters:
- Which chapter it supports (if any):
- If it's just personal context, keep it anyway
```

No memory is too small. No detail is too old. If it surfaced, it surfaced for a reason. Log it and let the relevance sort itself out later.

## Appendix C — ⛔ WITHHELD Markers (Fill Them In Later)

If you see: **⛔ WITHHELD — [Location]**

That means:

- The slot is preserved
- The purpose is preserved
- Truth wasn’t deleted
- You can fill it in later

WITHHELD doesn’t mean gone. It means held — for when it’s ready, for when you’re ready, or for when the right environment exists to hold it.

The marker itself is honest logging. That’s part of the system too.
