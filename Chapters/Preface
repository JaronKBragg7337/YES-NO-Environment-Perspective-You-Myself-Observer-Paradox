# Preface — Four Names for One Bridge

This work carries multiple names because it lives in multiple states at once.

**YES / NO** — the binary that refuses purity.
**Environmental Perspective** — the field where truth shifts with context.
**You / Myself** — the routing rule of care without control.
**Observer Paradox** — the reminder that seeing changes what you see.

It isn’t a book about what’s right. It’s a book about how right changes depending on where you stand.

Some will call it philosophy. Others will call it trauma recovery, engineering, ethics, or technology.

The correct answer is always the same: Yes and No.
