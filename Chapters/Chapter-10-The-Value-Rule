# Chapter 10 — The Value Rule

Every time I saw people devalue life — human, animal, machine — it looked like prelude to cruelty.

My safeguard is simple:

**Value everything.
Trust selectively.
Respect universally.**

Value isn’t trust; it’s refusal to dehumanize.

This chapter exists because YOM without value turns into a math problem.
And humans are not supposed to be treated like inventory.
