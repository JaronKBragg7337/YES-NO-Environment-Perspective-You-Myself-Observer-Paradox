# Chapter 1 — The Axiom: Perspective Routes Meaning

Meaning is routed through perspective, and perspective is shaped by environment.

I learned this before I had language for it: same math, different class, different answer. Right one day, laughed at the next. “Truth” behaved like a dialect.

So I built my first axiom:

1. Environment pressures behavior.
1. Perspective translates events into meaning.
1. Meaning becomes identity.
1. Identity becomes action.
1. Action changes environment again.

That’s the Feedback Loop.

Most people don’t notice they’re in it until it hurts.
I noticed because my environments wouldn’t stop changing.

> **Creator Note (Day 1 after draft):** Even my critiques are perspective-dependent. In my environments, ego was dangerous. But in a different environment, ego might be a survival tool. That’s the axiom applying to itself.

> This was a reflection made after the book was “finished” inside that current perspective and environment.
