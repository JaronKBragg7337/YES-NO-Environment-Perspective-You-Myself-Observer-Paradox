# Chapter 2 — The Routing Rule: Constraints → Capabilities → Collapse

I don’t build from opinions. I build from constraints.

Reality outranks belief. Gravity doesn’t negotiate. Cold doesn’t care about your intent.

So the routing rule is simple:

- **Constraints** define the boundaries.
- **Capabilities** define the play space.
- **Collapse** defines the moment one possibility becomes real.

Most systems collapse too early — they label, gate, and dictate. I delay collapse. I build floors instead of cages. Because choice only exists where superposition is allowed to live.
