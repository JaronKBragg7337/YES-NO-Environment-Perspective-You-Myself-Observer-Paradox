# Chapter 4 — The Heavy Observer vs. The Ghost Builder

To observe is to change.

A **heavy observer** measures reality and collapses it into one outcome.
A **ghost builder** sets constraints and steps back, allowing meaning to arrive later.

- Help that preserves agency = structure.
- Help that removes choice = control.

So I build like a ghost: power, water, tools, and learning — all capable, none coercive.
Meaning belongs to whoever walks across the bridge next.

The ethic is this:

*If you build a future so rigid it can’t host new meaning, you built a cage, not a bridge.*
