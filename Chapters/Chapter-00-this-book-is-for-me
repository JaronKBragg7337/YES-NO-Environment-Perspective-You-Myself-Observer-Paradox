# Chapter 0 — This Book Is for Me

I’m not writing this to be approved.
I’m not writing it to win arguments.
I’m not writing it to survive someone else’s label.

I’m writing it because when environments kept collapsing, I needed a way to see clearly without losing integrity.

Every time I tried to survive through someone else’s definition, something inside me broke. So this book is a rebuild.

A bridge, not a sermon.
A routing system, not a hierarchy.
A record of observation that refuses early collapse.

## Rules for Myself

- No ranking people.
- No scoring humans.
- No fixing others.
- No coercive “help.”
- Build for continuation, not compliance.

## Reader Clause — Not Worship, Not Collapse

This book is made for myself.

But if anyone else reads it — especially my kids — this isn’t for you to worship me like I’m better.

This is for you to understand how you can become better than me.

This isn’t a trauma dump. It’s my life experience and what I observed, written so you can see a whole different life, add that perspective to your own, and build beyond what I did.

If this book still exists 10 or 50 years from now and you’re reading it, the goal isn’t to become me.
The goal is to outgrow me.

If others read it later and find something inside it — good. If not, it still holds.

Because the purpose of a bridge isn’t to impress — it’s to hold weight.
