# Chapter 3 — Classifying the Classifier

Labeling is a form of collapse.

People love labels.
Philosophy. Religion. Business. System. Cult.

My answer? Yes and No.

The label says more about the observer than the observed.
When you call this philosophy, I see your hunger for ideas.
When you call it survivalism, I see your fear of scarcity.
When you call it a framework, I see your logic craving order.

Every classifier reveals its environment.

So I record them, not to correct — but to map perspective entropy.
A system that works across environments can’t rely on a single name.
It just has to hold weight.
