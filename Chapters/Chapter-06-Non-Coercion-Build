# Chapter 6 — Non-Coercion Build: Help vs Control

To build ethically, never confuse support with submission.

Systems love to “help” by defining you. That’s still domination.
A floor holds you without judgment; a cage holds you with justification.

My rule:

- Floors before cages.
- Capabilities before identity.
- Environment before ideology.

That’s non-coercion engineering. It’s not soft — it’s structural respect.

And this is where You Over Myself starts showing up as more than a feeling.
Because the fastest way to betray care is to control someone “for their own good.”
