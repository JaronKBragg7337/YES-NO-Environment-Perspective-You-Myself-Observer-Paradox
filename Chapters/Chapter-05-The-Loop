# Chapter 5 — The Loop: Failure Is Real but Not Permanent

I don’t chase perfection anymore. I chase continuation.

Failure is metadata — it marks where the structure cracked.
The danger isn’t falling — it’s mistaking the fall for your identity.

So the rebuild loop goes:

1. Collapse.
1. Log.
1. Extract principle.
1. Rebuild smaller.
1. Continue.

Not charismatic. Not romantic. But real — and functional in any environment.
